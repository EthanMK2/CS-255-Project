# CS-255-Project

  DriverPass was the client for this project. They wanted a web-based, cloud infrastructure application that helps students pass the DMV driving test. The application 
design includes the ability for students to take tests and courses, schedule driving lessons, and browse special offers.
  
  The part I did well was the "objectives and goals" section in the business requirements document. It felt like I had thouroughly captured the various application
requirements. This helped me finish the rest of the document with relative ease.
  The part I would revise would be the "assumptions" and "limitations" sections in the business requirements document. It's hard to take a step back from all the 
brainstorming and think through all the things we take for granted. We get used to all the systems that pre-exist ours, and do not realize that those systems have 
their limits and failures, too.
  
  I interpreted user's needs by stepping into their perspective, and thinking about how that can be achieved through a system design. Keeping things simple in overall 
design helps set the goals straight, and going through details separately helps make the process of design a lot easier. This is part of how I approach designing 
software. I take myself back to the basics, and add the details slowly and precisely. No detail should be left out when we start the specific designs though, because 
then simplicity can be a problem.
